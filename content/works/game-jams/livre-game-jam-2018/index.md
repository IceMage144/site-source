In this jam we made "Shin Ara Loop", a game where the main character is stuck in a time loop, in a way that she goes back to its start when she sleeps (like what happens at ["Groundhog Day"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)). To make sure this doesn't happen anymore, you heve to help her to fix the the church's clock.

The theme was "Finally, now i'm truly free", and the jam also had some achievements (like optional sub-themes), and we acomplished two of them:
* I'm out of words!: Don't use any written word in your game, in any language
* Polygloth: Use at least 3 languages in your game (excluding credits and menus)

Throughout the game we used icons and symbols to replace words, and we also put together three words from three different languanges to create the game's title ("Shin ara loop" means "New time loop", "Shin" been "new" in japanese, "ara" been "time" in tupi and "loop" been in plain english).
