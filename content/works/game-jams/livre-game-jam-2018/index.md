Our team from [USPGameDev](https://uspgamedev.org/) went to UNICAMP again to participate. We made the game "Shin Ara Loop", a game where the day keep looping back when you sleep (like what happens at ["Groundhog Day"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groundhog_Day_(film)) and, to make sure this doesn't happen anymore, you have to fix the church's clock. The theme was "Finally I'm free", and the jam also had some achievements (like optional sub-themes), and we accomplished two of them: create a game without words and use three languages at the game ("Shin ara loop" means "New time loop", "Shin" been "new" in japanese, "ara" been "time" in tupi and "loop" been in plain english).
