A 48-hour gobal game jam. [IME hosted a site](https://globalgamejam.org/2020/jam-sites/usp-ggj) and we divided [USPGameDev](https://uspgamedev.org/) into two groups. My group created "Keeping It Up", a game about keeping your constructions up while you defend the city agains evil aliens. The theme was "Repair".
