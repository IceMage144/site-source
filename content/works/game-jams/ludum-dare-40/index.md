We made "L.A.V.A. series L.A.M.P. edition vs the world", a cyberpunk shooter, where the goal is to kill as many waves of monsters you can, using dozens of different weapons.

This edition's theme was "The more you have, the worse it is". You get a new weapon after each wave, and have to assign each one to a different key in the keyboard. As the time passes it gets harder to remember were each weapon was.
