Our team from [USPGameDev](https://uspgamedev.org/) got together again to make "It's all about lasagna!", a farming game with a terror mood were a kid get to their grandma's house and decides to make a lasagna while she doesn't arrive. The theme was "Combine two incompatible genres", and we combined the peaceful and harmless life at the farm with the mood of a terror movie.
