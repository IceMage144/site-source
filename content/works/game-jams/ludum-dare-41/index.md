We made "It's all about lasagna!", a farming game with a terror mood, where a kid goes to their grandma's house and decides to make a lasagna while she doesn't arrive.

The theme was "Combine two incompatible genres", and we combined the peaceful and harmless life at the farm with the mood of a terror movie.
