A 48-hour game jam organized by [LivreCamp](https://www.livrecamp.org/), [Gamux](http://www.gamux.com.br/) and [Fellowship of the game](http://www.fog.icmc.usp.br/) to promote the use of free software. Our team from [USPGameDev](https://uspgamedev.org/) went to UNICAMP to participate.

We made the game "Network Battle: Chain Hostility", an assimetric multiplayer game about a cyberwar between a hacker and the government.

The jam had the 4 themes listed below, from which the the groups had to choose two.
* Less is more
* Viral
* Links
* Privacy

It also had 9 achievements, from which our group won two of them
* Thunderbird: Create a game that is related (in mechanic or theme) with a game from the other jam site
* Don't know how to choose: The game was made using all the 4 themes

Our game was related in theme with [Password Protected](https://robotinc.itch.io/password), and also includes all the themes either in its gameplay or in its theme.
