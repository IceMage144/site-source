A 48-hour game jam organized by [LivreCamp](https://www.livrecamp.org/), [Gamux](http://www.gamux.com.br/) and [Fellowship of the game](http://www.fog.icmc.usp.br/) to promote the use of free software. Our team from [USPGameDev](https://uspgamedev.org/) went to UNICAMP to participate. We made the game "Network Battle: Chain Hostility", an assimetric multiplayer game about a cyberwar between a hacker and the government.
