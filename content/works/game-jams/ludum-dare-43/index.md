In this jam we made "Mechamorphosis", a game where you are a rusty robot that was captured by an evil organization that wants to turn you and your friends into mechanical waste. The goal is to aquire new parts to yourself, defeat all the guard robots and escape the building.

The theme was "Sacrifices must be made", we created a mechanic where you have to sacrifice a part and get a new one to get to the next room. Some parts give you buffs and other debuffs, and you have to deal with them through the game.
