An io-like online multiplayer, where you control a pirate ship and have to shoot other people's ships to destroy them. It's a browser game, that can be played either from desktop or from mobile devices.

The project had two phases. I contributed a lot for the first one, but after that it was used as an agile methodology classes' project, that I was not enrolled, so I stopped contributing to it and started supporting the other developers's work.
