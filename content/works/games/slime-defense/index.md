A work that I made with Eduardo Evaristo for a culture and extension class. It is a tower defense were you are a slime that is trying to protect your chest of money from a variaety of enemies. You have the ability to walk through the map and collect resources, so you can create friends with your body pieces to help protecting your precious resources.
