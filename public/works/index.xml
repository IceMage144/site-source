      <description>A 48-hour gobal game jam. IME hosted a site and we divided USPGameDev into two groups. My group created &amp;ldquo;Mother&amp;rsquo;s home&amp;rdquo;, a game where you are a little creative kid, that adventures through an imaginary maze in his house to play with his toys, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to get far from his mom. The theme was &amp;ldquo;What home means to you&amp;rdquo;, and the game explores how the house feels like an unknown place to the kid, as his mother is his real home.</description>
