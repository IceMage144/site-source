      <description>Our team from USPGameDev went to UNICAMP again to participate. We made the game &amp;ldquo;Shin Ara Loop&amp;rdquo;, a game where the day keep looping back when you sleep (like what happens at &amp;ldquo;Groundhog Day&amp;rdquo; and, to make sure this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen anymore, you have to fix the church&amp;rsquo;s clock. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Finally I&amp;rsquo;m free&amp;rdquo;, also the jam had some achievements (like optional sub-themes), and we accomplished two of them: create a game without words and use three languages at the game (&amp;ldquo;Shin ara loop&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;New time loop&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Shin&amp;rdquo; been &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; in japanese, &amp;ldquo;ara&amp;rdquo; been &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; in tupi and &amp;ldquo;loop&amp;rdquo; been &amp;ldquo;loop&amp;rdquo; in english).</description>
