      <description>A 48-hour gobal game jam. IME hosted a site and we divided USPGameDev into two groups. My group created &amp;ldquo;Mother&amp;rsquo;s home&amp;rdquo;, a game where you are a little creative kid, that adventures through an imaginary maze in his house to play with his toys, but don&amp;rsquo;t want to get far from his mom. The theme was &amp;ldquo;What home means to you&amp;rdquo;, and the game explores how the house feels like an unknown place to the kid, as his mother is his real home.</description>

      <description>Our team from USPGameDev got together again to make &amp;ldquo;Mechamorphosis&amp;rdquo;, a game where you&amp;rsquo;re a rusty robot captured by an evil corporation that wants to turn you and your friends into mechanical waste, and the objective is to acquire parts to yourself, kill all the guard robots and escape from the building. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Sacrifices must be made&amp;rdquo;, and we created a mechanic where you have to sacrifice a part and get another one to pass to the next room.</description>

      <description>Our team from USPGameDev went to UNICAMP again to participate. We made the game &amp;ldquo;Shin Ara Loop&amp;rdquo;, a game where the day keep looping back when you sleep (like what happens at &amp;ldquo;Groundhog Day&amp;rdquo; and, to make sure this doesn&amp;rsquo;t happen anymore, you have to fix the church&amp;rsquo;s clock. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Finally I&amp;rsquo;m free&amp;rdquo;, also the jam had some achievements (like optional sub-themes), and we accomplished two of them: create a game without words and use three languages at the game (&amp;ldquo;Shin ara loop&amp;rdquo; means &amp;ldquo;New time loop&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Shin&amp;rdquo; been &amp;ldquo;new&amp;rdquo; in japanese, &amp;ldquo;ara&amp;rdquo; been &amp;ldquo;time&amp;rdquo; in tupi and &amp;ldquo;loop&amp;rdquo; been &amp;ldquo;loop&amp;rdquo; in english).</description>
