      <description>Our team from USPGameDev got together again to make &amp;ldquo;Mechamorphosis&amp;rdquo;, a game where you&amp;rsquo;re a rusty robot captured by an evil corporation that wants to turn you and your friends into mechanical waste, and the objective is to acquire parts to yourself, kill all the guard robots and escape from the building. The theme was &amp;ldquo;Sacrifices must be made&amp;rdquo;, and we created a mechanic where you have to sacrifice a part and get another one to pass to the next room.</description>
